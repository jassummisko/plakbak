# Plakbak - a pastebin-based distribution system for ComputerCraft

Plakbak takes all files in a source folder (by default `src/`) and uploads a script to pastebin.com that unpacks all of its contents.
Config information is located in `config.plakbak`, which is generated when plakbak program is first run in a given directory.
Follow the instructions given to you by plakbak to configure it.
